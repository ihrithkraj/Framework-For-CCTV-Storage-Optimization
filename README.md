# Framework for Storage Optimization in CCTV Recordings

**<a href = "https://github.com/satviktiwari/Minor-Project/tree/main/Data-Output">Data Output</a>**: contains logfiles having data of objects detected and other relevent information assosiated with them.<br>
**<a href = "https://github.com/satviktiwari/Minor-Project/tree/main/Static-Website">Static-Website</a>**: Temporary website for displaying output.<br>
**<a href = "https://github.com/satviktiwari/Minor-Project/tree/main/Video-Outputs">Video-Outputs</a>**: Final output video after processing.<br>

## Distance calculation methods used:<br>
**Normal Distance**: Gives the numerical measurement of how far apart objects or points are in two consecutive frames.<br>
**Euclidean Distance**: Provides the Euclidean distance between two points in Euclidean space which is the length of a line segment between the two points.<br>
**Manhattan Distance**: Provides the Manhattan distance which is the distance between two points measured along axes at right angles.<br>
**Discrete Cosine Transform**: Provides a finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different points.<br>


## Python scripts:<br>
**<a href = "https://github.com/satviktiwari/Minor-Project/blob/main/Bounding_boxes.py">Bounding_boxes.py</a>**: Code to detect object and create bounding box around them.<br>
**<a href = "https://github.com/satviktiwari/Minor-Project/blob/main/Euclidean_dist.py">Eculedian_dist.py</a>**: Code to find Eucledian Distance between objects.<br>
**<a href = "https://github.com/satviktiwari/Minor-Project/blob/main/fileClear.py">fileClear.py</a>**: Program to clear log files.<br>
**<a href = "https://github.com/satviktiwari/Minor-Project/blob/main/fileConverter.py">fileConverter.py</a>**: Program to convert output video files from one form to other form. (e.g. avi to mp4)<br>
**<a href = "https://github.com/satviktiwari/Minor-Project/blob/main/Main.py">Main.py</a>**: Program to reduce storage space by implimenting the actual algorithm.<br>
**<a href = "https://github.com/satviktiwari/Minor-Project/blob/main/temp.py">temp.py</a>**: back-up of Main.py file<br>
